# hello-world
This is my very first repository on GitHub.  I am creating this in order to take a test for a computer coding bootcamp! Exciting!! 
I am a pretty awesome lady who is new to the coding world.  I have always been interested computers and tech, and my life has finally taken me back to a point where I can start pursing my dream of coding.
